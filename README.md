# City-View-Illustration-in-Adobe-Illustrator
The design was started by making simple 2D building illustrations but then by using Perspective Grid Tool the design was converted to a 3D art. Then, just the copies of buildings were designed. Then, sky and ground grass was added.   Designing Credits: Muhammad Ali
